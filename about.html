	<h2>My Interests</h2>
	<p> My name is Shaumik Kalwit. I am in Middle School trying
	to learn Programming and many other cool things. I like 
	singing and I am the Advanced Choir of my school. Not only
	that, but I love music. My #1 Pet Peeve is do NOT be a 
	hypocrite. If I am being one, please let me know nicely.
	I like watching sports along with watching anime and 
	reading manga. <p>
