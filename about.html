		<p> Hi! My name is Shaumik Kalwit! I am in Middle School and I live in the Bay Area in California. <br> I enjoy spending times with friends and family. In my free time, I might choose to do programming <br> or I might read a book. One of my favorite books is The Hobbit. I love watching anime and reading <br> manga. One of my hobbies is playing basketball in my free time. Another one is singing. I am in my <br> school's Advanced Choir and we have been all over the country. One of them being Carnegie Hall in <br> New York. I love travelling and visiting new places. Along with traveling, I also love to eat food from <br> different places. My favorite food is usually burgers with fries on the side! Last but not least, I love to <br> sleep. </p>
